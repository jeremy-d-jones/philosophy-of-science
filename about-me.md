## Jeremy D. Jones

I am a systems thinker and philosophical technologist exploring the intersection of scientific epistemology, inference models, and the human limits of justification. With a background in cloud architecture and formal training in philosophy, I bring infrastructure thinking to metaphysical questions â€” and vice versa.

This work represents over two decades of independent thought on how science, cognition, and justification can be reframed in pragmatic, non-metaphysical terms.

Many of these writings were first developed between **2003 and 2006** as part of my undergraduate philosophy work. I have chosen to preserve them in their original form â€” errors, false starts, and all â€” as a record of philosophical development over time.

**Current focus**: Applying the concept of _Ultimate Utility_ to AI model trust, black-box systems, and the philosophy of explanation in machine learning.
