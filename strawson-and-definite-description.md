# Strawson and Definite Description

P. F. Strawson in his essay On Referring defines what he calls the “uniquely referring use” of expressions.  Such expressions typically involve the use of singular subject-predicate sentences.  These were the types of expressions dealt with by Bertrand Russell in his Theory of Descriptions[^russell-refs].  Strawson intends to show that Russell misunderstood the nature of these expressions by outlining Russell’s theory then subsequently illustrating its problems.  I intend to show that Strawson’s theory, so far as it can be called one, is indicative of the context driven nature of language and written communication, at least in the English speaking world.  I also intend to show that Russell’s Theory of Descriptions is sufficient for the Logician or Computer Scientist but lacks the ability to cope with the semantic nature of human communication.

## I.  Russell’s View

Ultimately, we are separated from objects in the world and the intentions of others.  We only come to know objects and intentions through description.  Definite Description is the idea that every proper name is ultimately a description of the properties of the individual thing to which the proper name refers.  The grammatical name of an object is oftentimes not a sufficient account of the properties of an object.  Hence, grammatical names do not entail logical descriptions.  Any adequate theory of description must solve three problems, the third of which is the problem of propositions about non-existent entities.  I can make statements about unicorns, leprechauns, and Cardinal’s Super Bowl victories though none of these entities exist.  Yet certainly I cannot call the propositions made about them meaningless because people discuss these things every day.  Moreover, they discuss non-existent propositions under the supposed pretensions of meaningful communication.  But what is it which makes a proposition meaningful?

Russell’s Theory of Descriptions revolves around two ideas.  (1) A sentence is meaningful only if it possesses a truth value and (2) all well formed sentences are necessarily meaningful.  Hence, all well formed sentences must posses a truth value.  But, how are we to determine the truth value of a sentence which takes a non-existing object as its subject?

If we have a name for an existent or non-existent entity then it has a logical description which entails the fact of whether or not it exists.  Although I am not referencing any existing entity the meaning is preserved through the conjunction of the separate propositions of the logical description.  When speaking of non-existent entities the existential conjunction of the logical description is negated.  Therefore, all statements about non-existent entities are false.  Since they retain a truth value (false) they also retain their meaningfulness.

For example, when someone states “the king of France is wise” Russell believes they have made three assumptions:  (1) There is a king of France and (2) there is not more than one king of France and (3) the king of France is wise.  If any of the three can be found to be false then the entire conjunction is false.  Since (1) is false (France is not a monarchy) the truth value of S is false and thus it retains its’ meaningfulness.[^strawson-ref]  

## II. Strawson’s View

Any statement of Strawson’s view must begin with his outline of the differences between a sentence, its use, and its utterances.  A sentence is any collection of words in a particular language suitably arranged for interpretation by another individual.  A sentence can be spoken at different times and in different places both about the same subject and about different subjects.  Sentence S could be false now while being true when a French monarch existed.  On both occasions S is the same but the truth value is not.  So, contrary to Russell’s view, a sentence does not possess any truth value.  

An expression is the referent component of a sentence.  In S, the expression is “the king of France.”  We can outline the differences between expressions, their utterances, and usages in the same way we do for sentences.  An expression does not refer to an individual entity since the same expression can be used to refer to many entities.  So, contrary to Russell’s view, an expression does not possess any reference.

A sentence may be used to make a true or false proposition.  Likewise, an expression may be used to refer to an individual entity.  Hence, truth values and references belong to the use of sentences and expressions, not to the sentences and expressions themselves.  But if truth value and reference do not belong to sentences and expressions, how can they be considered meaningful?

Meaningfulness is a function of the sentence or expression.  Meaning is something we attach to sentences and expressions via context.  Without the framework of context we cannot attach a meaning to any propositions.  What we attach to sentences and expressions are “general directions for the use of [the] sentence [or expression]…in making true or false ascertains [and] referring to particular objects or persons”, respectively.  Hence, the meaning of a particular sentence “cannot be identified with the assertion it is used, on a particular occasion, to make.”  Likewise, the meaning of an expression cannot be identified with “the object it is used, on a particular occasion, to refer to.”[^strawson-ref]       

## III. My View

Russell and Strawson disagree on the nature of meaning.  Particularly, how meaning is applied to propositions.  Russell believes that meaning is tied to the logical description of a particular object. Strawson maintains that meaning is driven via context.  Contrary to Strawson, Russell believes all sentences are necessarily meaningful.  Russell maintains that when I make a proposition about a particular entity I unwittingly assert the existence of that particular entity.  Strawson maintains that when I make a proposition about a particular entity I have implied that particular entity’s existence. 

The sole difference between affirming and implying existence is the question “how do we attach meaning to existence?”  For Russell, the existential state of a proposition is fundamental to meaning.  But his theory proposes necessary meaningfulness only by striping meaning from words.  Words are the fundamental building blocks of communication and are primarily semantics driven.  Without context we cannot account for semantics.  While Russell’s existential statements are well formed for the communication of computers they are not well formed for human communications.  Simply too much exists to be accounted for by logical description.  The expressive power of logical description is too powerful in the realm of syntax to expect it to also deal with semantics.  Emotions cannot be accounted for by logic.  Yet all words maintain an intimate relation to emotion.  

Strawson’s definitions of the use and utterance of sentences and expressions leave much to be desired in the way of a formal theory of description.  Unfortunately, his definitions also leave many of the things we communicate to one another within the realm of nonsense.  We all live under the “guise of meaningful communication” yet his theory cannot create necessary meaningfulness.  When I make propositions about non-existent entities others can use my statements to make further propositions and decisions which directly relate to action.  My words of encouragement on the football field, “Can’t nobody stop THE HYPE”, certainly spur others listening to spirit and can even affect the outcome of the game.  Strawson’s account leaves statements of this kind outside the realm of meaningfulness because they do not refer to any existing “hype” or because they imply the existence of some “hype” which does not actually exist.  But the “hype” to which I am referring is spiritual and spiritual statements carry enough meaning to cause war, death, and love.

Ultimately, both theories fall short of the actual nature of communication.  Certainly, Russell’s logical descriptions have their place in a “web-of-belief” which affects how I interact with the world.  As I write this essay, I am formally applying his very ideas.   No less certainly, usage carries the weight of meaning because usage depends on context.   Meaning cannot be evaluated without context.  And humans cannot exist without context.  While riding the fence is not a good philosophical standpoint, in the case of Strawson and Russell and their competing theories of description, it is the only reasonable standpoint.
