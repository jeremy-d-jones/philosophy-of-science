# Philosophy of Science and Epistemology

This project is a digital archive of my original philosophical work exploring the structure of scientific reasoning, the realism/antirealism debate, and a concept I call **Ultimate Utility** — a non-metaphysical justification framework grounded in empirical success.

Topics include:
- Scientific antirealism and inference to the best explanation
- Epistemic circularity as a necessary feature of finite cognition
- Rejection of metaphysical truth schemes in favor of functional consistency
- Reinterpretation of theories as tools rather than mirrors
