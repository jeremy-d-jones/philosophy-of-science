# Long form writing about Philosophy of Science and Epistemology

I wrote all of these while in college between 2003 - 2007. I'm putting them up here to give potential employers a sample of my writing which pre-dates AI they can use as a reference point when judging my applications. I formatted the text for markdown but none of the content in any of the documents has changed since it was originally written. 


Topics include:
- Scientific antirealism and inference to the best explanation
- Epistemic circularity as a necessary feature of finite cognition
- Rejection of metaphysical truth schemes in favor of functional consistency
